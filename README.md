# taxi-cab-project

## Project Description
### In this final project, we processed the yellow taxi data and uber data from 2009 Jan to 2015 Jun to have a general idea of the transportation. Also, we combined the hourly and daily weather data to see the influences of wind speed and precipitation. We finished the data processing, data storing and all the SQL related requirements. Also we created four diagrams which help to visualize the data. We got 2 data visualization left.
